Currently, this only includes results from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey (preliminary, publicly released data at 350 micro-m).\r\n\r\nIf you have used FilFinder, please consider adding similar figures to the gallery! To add your own figures, create a fork of the [repository](https://github.com/e-koch/FilFinder_Results/). Clone your fork to a local location, add your figures, commit the changes, then push to your fork. Finally, submit a pull request to have it included with the rest of the collection!\r\n\r\nWe hope for this site to contain examples of running FilFinder on a range of datasets, making it easier for members of the community to decide if FilFinder is an appropriate analysis tool for their data.\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br /><span xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" property=\"dct:title\">FilFinder_Results</span> by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"FilFinder_Results.github.io\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">Eric Koch</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.<br />Based on a work at <a xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" href=\"https://github.com/e-koch/FilFinder\" rel=\"dct:source\">https://github.com/e-koch/FilFinder</a>.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
